/**
 * Computes a weighted vertex cover in an undirected graph. A vertex cover of a graph is a set of
 * vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. A
 * minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover having the smallest possible number of vertices for a
 * given graph. The size of a minimum vertex cover of a graph G is known as the vertex cover number.
 * A vertex cover of minimum weight is a vertex cover where the sum of weights assigned to the
 * individual vertices in the cover has been minimized. The minimum vertex cover problem is a
 * special case of the minimum weighted vertex cover problem where all vertices have equal weight.
 * Consequently, any algorithm designed for the weighted version of the problem can also solve
 * instances of the unweighted version.
