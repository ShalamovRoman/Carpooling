/**
 * Generator which produces the
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphComplement.html">complement graph</a> of a given input
 * graph. The complement $\overline{G}$ of a graph $G$ consists of the same vertices as $G$, but
 * whose edge set consists of the edges not in $G$.
 * <p>
 * More formally, let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and let $K$ consist of all 2-element subsets of $V$.
 * Then $\overline{G} = (V, K \setminus E)$ is the complement of $G$, where $K \setminus E$ is the
 * relative complement of $E$ in $K$. For directed graphs, the complement can be defined in the same
 * way, as a directed graph on the same vertex set, using the set of all 2-element ordered pairs of
 * $V$ in place of the set $K$ in the formula above.
 * <p>
 * The complement is not defined for multigraphs. If a multigraph is provided as input to this
 * generator, it will be treated as if it is a simple graph.
