 * of edges. Graphs with multiple edges are allowed.

 * <p>
 * The algorithm is a variant of the Bellman-Ford algorithm but instead of only storing the best
 * path it stores the "k" best paths at each pass, yielding a complexity of O(k*n*(m^2)) where m is
 * the number of edges and n is the number of vertices.
