/**
 * Convenience class to manage extensions/encapsulations. This class creates and manages object
 * extensions and encapsulations. An object, from here on denoted as 'original', can be encapsulated
 * in or extended by another object. An example would be the relation between an edge (original) and
 * an annotated edge. The annotated edge encapsulates/extends an edge, thereby augmenting it with
 * additional data. In symbolic form, if b is the original class, than a(b) would be its extension.
 * This concept is similar to java's extension where one class is derived from (extends) another
 * class (original).
