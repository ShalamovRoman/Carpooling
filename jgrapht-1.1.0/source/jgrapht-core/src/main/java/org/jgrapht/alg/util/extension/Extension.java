/**
 * Class which represents an abstract extension/encapsulation object. An object, from here on
 * denoted as original,can be encapsulated in or extended by another object. An example would be the
 * relation between an edge (original) and an annotated edge. The annotated edge
 * encapsulates/extends an edge, thereby augmenting it with additional data. In symbolic form, if b
 * is the original class, than a(b) would be its extension. This concept is similar to java's
 * extension where one class is derived from (extends) another class (original).
