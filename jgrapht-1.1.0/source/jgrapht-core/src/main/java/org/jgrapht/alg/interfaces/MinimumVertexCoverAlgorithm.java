 * size of a minimum vertex cover of a graph G is known as the vertex cover number. A vertex cover
 * of minimum weight is a vertex cover where the sum of weights assigned to the individual vertices
 * in the cover has been minimized. The minimum vertex cover problem is a special case of the
 * minimum weighted vertex cover problem where all vertices have equal weight.
