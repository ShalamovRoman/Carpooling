/**
 * An undirected view of the backing directed graph specified in the constructor. This graph allows
 * modules to apply algorithms designed for undirected graphs to a directed graph by simply ignoring
 * edge direction. If the backing directed graph is an
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrientedGraph.html">oriented graph</a>, then the view will
 * be a simple graph; otherwise, it will be a multigraph. Query operations on this graph "read
 * through" to the backing graph. Attempts to add edges will result in an
 * <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>, but vertex addition/removal and edge removal are all
 * supported (and immediately reflected in the backing graph).
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that edges returned by this graph's accessors are really just the edges of the underlying
 * directed graph. Since there is no interface distinction between directed and undirected edges,
 * this detail should be irrelevant to algorithms.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This graph does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals operations through to the backing graph,
 * but relies on <tt>Object</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt> methods. This graph will be
 * serializable if the backing graph is serializable.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
