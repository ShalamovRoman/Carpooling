/**
 * Harmonic centrality.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The harmonic centrality of a vertex x is defined as H(x)=\sum_{y \neq x} 1/d(x,y), where d(x,y)
 * is the shortest path distance from x to y. In case a distance d(x,y)=\infinity, then 1/d(x,y)=0.
 * When normalization is used the score is divided by n-1 where n is the total number of vertices in
 * the graph.
 *
 * For details see the following papers:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Yannick Rochat. Closeness centrality extended to unconnected graphs: The harmonic centrality
 * index. Applications of Social Network Analysis, 2009.</li>
 * <li>Newman, Mark. 2003. The Structure and Function of Complex Networks. SIAM Review, 45(mars),
 * 167â€“256.</li>
 * </ul>
 * and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality">wikipedia</a> article.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation computes by default the centrality using outgoing paths and normalizes the
 * scores. This behavior can be adjusted by the constructor arguments.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Shortest paths are computed either by using Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall depending on
 * whether the graph has edges with negative edge weights. Thus, the running time is either O(n (m +
 * n logn)) or O(n^3) respectively, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges of
 * the graph.
 * 
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
